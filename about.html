                   <br><p>Ever since I was a child, my love for traveling and wanting to explore the world originally came
                    from reading. I used to check out books at my Elementary School's Library as well as the one in
                    my town where I still live. They started as simple picture books that showed the different wonders
                    of the world, which led to learning more about World History in school, watching the History
                    Channel, and eventually growing up and saving money to travel to many of the places I dreamt of
                    going to!</p>
                    <p>As I started college, however, I realized that it would be difficult to continue traveling while
                    focusing on classes and saving while not working during the academic year. Additionally, Covid-19
                    halted my travel plans for a little over a year, but I was able to continue my classes online while
                    working several jobs since then. By putting long hours into working and making the most of my time
                    during quarantine, I was able to save more money than I ever have, and begin traveling once again
                    by May 2021. Since then, I have been to Las Vegas, Nevada and will be going to Vermont the week
                    before Christmas.</p>
                    <p>Over time, my passion for traveling and learning about different countries, cultures, etc. grew
                        to where I also wanted to inspire other young adults to travel and see the world. Whether you
                        have already been to every continent or never left your hometown or state, my aim is to show you
                        what is truly out there in terms of joy, experience, culture, and opportunities.
                        The best part about traveling with each trip is ironically the journey. My journey is only
                    beginning, as I still have yet to leave the country, but I am currently in the process of obtaining
                    my passport and planning trips across the globe. </p>
